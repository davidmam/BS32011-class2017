BS32011 Meeting 4 notes
Last meeting: aligned sequences on jalview, then met in library to discuss jalview.
Current meeting: restriction analysis, by next week the presenter will provide 1-2 slides in the meeting to show progression.
Restriction enzyme classes: a) Cuts in site b) Cuts after/before site 
When comparing restriction sites between sequences, the unique ones are the ones that we care about.
Be careful with gaps in the alignment, the script must account for them.
For next week: Recalibrate position to add gaps

Adding -help after the command gives you the mandatory qualifiers.
history gives you all previous commands.

In bases: N = A/T/G/C 
R = Purines A/G 
Y = Pyrimidines T/C 
S = Strongly bonded C-G 
W = Weakly bonded A-T 
K = C/A 
M = G/T
B = Not A 
D = Not C 
H = Not G 
v = Not T 
For next week: Count the gaps in the command prompt.
You can use the multiple alignment from jalview.
