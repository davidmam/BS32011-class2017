MINUTES

Date: 24/01/17
Time: 12 noon
Location: Museum, Carnelley basement
Attendees: David Martin, Eleanor Adams (presenter), George Krontiris (chair), Roseanne Smith (secretary)
Aligning sequences on Jalview: Circular genomes may not have the same start and end point, as identified in Wildcat. 
It could be edited directly by moving bases from the beginning to the end (cut and paste) so all sequences start at Phenylalanine. 

Create realignment program: sequencerealigner.py

Actions:
•	Add Genbank and FASTA files links to table on GitHub
•	Sign up to the Life Sciences server
•	Align sequences on Jalview in order to begin restriction site analysis
