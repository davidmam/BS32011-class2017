BS32011 Project A Lab Meeting (3/2/2017)
Attendees: David Martin, George Krontiris, Eleanor Adams, Roseanne Smith
Previous meeting discussion: Created a script on Python that rewrites positions to include gaps.
Current meeting: Worked with Dvaid to create a python script that would identify infrequent cutters
Next meeting: Look at identification of primers using primer 3

We need to be able to creat a script that will be able to identify which resctictions are present in one sequence but not the other.
This would allow us to preform a cut on one species and not the other when the enzyme is used.
Then, by identifying primers and carrying out a PCR reaction we would be able to preform an electrophoresis.
This would allow us to identify between the species using only the mitochondrial DNA.
